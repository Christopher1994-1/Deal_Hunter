# Deal Hunter



My Deal Hunter is an automated web scraping project that helps me stay on top of the latest deals at my favorite store. With DealHunter, I can easily set up a system that automatically collects and formats the weekly deals data from my store's website and sends it to my phone as a text message, so I never miss out on a good deal.

Using the power of web scraping and automation, DealHunter simplifies the process of monitoring weekly deals, saving me time and effort. Simply configure the project to run whenever you log into your computer, and let it do the rest. The project can be customized to work with any store or website, allowing you to tailor it to your specific needs.
